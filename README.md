## About Me
Hi, I'm Simon Waiblinger, known as simwai or Wobby, a full-stack developer from Vorarlberg, Austria, with 5 years of experience meticulously crafting fast and reliable systems.

I specialize in Vue (my favorite) and Angular for dynamic user interfaces, backed by solid server-side experience in Node.js and .NET. Automation drives much of my work – developing bots, scrapers, and trading algorithms to eliminate complexity and wasted cycles.

My approach is guided by Clean Code, the Law of Demeter, and principles like KISS and DRY. I design software using proven patterns such as Observer, Strategy, Monad, Mixin, and Command. I prefer MVVM, hand-crafted DI, and favor composition over inheritance. CUPID and SOLID principles shape my architectural decisions, and I'm a dedicated follower of the Agile Manifesto.

I deliberately avoid no-code tools, React, Lerna, and Nx – flexibility and genuine code ownership matter more than convenience. I'm also strictly against vibecoding. Early commits might show traces, but those days are archived. Every line now serves intent, scalability, and correctness.

Notable contributions include merged PRs to npm-packlist, a dependency of the npm CLI that saves millions of euros in development time. I authored the PowerShell deployment script for freqtrade and implemented a scheduled trading cooldown reset feature. I also fixed a critical bug in XO where the tool ignored rules in the configuration.

Outside work, balance keeps me grounded. Taekwondo hones my focus, meditation (mudras, Qi Gong) builds body awareness, and the gym builds resilience. I enjoy freeriding in winter and beach escapes on vacations. Dance styles like shuffle and hip-hop fuel creativity, while swimming refreshes me. Alpha wave music keeps me in flow while coding. Visiting galleries, concerts, and social events expands my perspectives and strengthens my network. Family, laughter, nature, and restoring old items keep me centered.

Creatively, I'm inspired by Salvador Dalí's surrealism. In programming, I admire sindresorhus for TypeScript expertise and xmatthias for Python mastery.

I'm open to freelance or full-time opportunities, remote or on-site, in German or English. Innovative fields such as FinTech particularly excite me.
