## About Me
Hi, I’m Simon Waiblinger, known as simwai or Wobby, a full-stack developer from Vorarlberg, Austria, with 4 years of experience meticulously crafting fast, and reliabe systems.

I specialize in Vue (my favorite) and Angular for dynamic user interfaces, backed by solid server-side experience in Node.js and .NET. Automation drives much of my work – developing bots, scrapers, and trading algorithms to simplify complex tasks.

My approach is guided by Clean Code, the Law of Demeter, and principles like KISS and DRY. I design software using proven patterns such as Observer, Strategy, Mixin, and Command. I prefer MVVM and favor composition over inheritance. CUPID and SOLID principles shape my architectural decisions, and I’m a dedicated follower of the Agile Manifesto. While I use Dependency Injection extensively, I avoid IoC frameworks to maintain full control over my code.

I avoid no-code tools, React, Lerna, and Nx, valuing flexibility and hands-on code ownership.

Notable contributions include merged PRs to npm-packlist, a dependency of the npm CLI that saves millions of euros in development time. I authored the PowerShell deployment script for freqtrade and implemented a scheduled trading cooldown reset feature. I also fixed a critical bug in XO where the tool ignored @stylistic rules in the configuration, potentially affecting other settingsxx.

Outside work, balance keeps me grounded. Taekwondo hones my focus, meditation (mudras, Qi Gong) clears my mind, and the gym builds resilience. I enjoy freeriding in winter and beach on vacations. Dance styles like shuffle and hip-hop fuel creativity, while swimming refreshes me. Visiting galleries, concerts, and social events expands my perspectives and strengthens my network. Family, laughter, nature, and restoring old items keep me centered.

Creatively, I’m inspired by Salvador Dalí’s surrealism. In programming, I admire Sindre Sorhus for TypeScript expertise and Xmatthis for Python mastery—figures who set the bar I strive to reach.

I’m open to freelance or full-time opportunities, remote or on-site, in German or English. Innovative fields such as FinTech particularly excite me.
