## About Me
Hi, I'm Simon Waiblinger, known as simwai or Wobby, a full-stack developer from Vorarlberg, Austria, with 5 years of experience meticulously crafting fast and reliable systems.

Specializing in Vue (my favorite) and Angular for dynamic user interfaces, backed by solid server-side experience in Node.js and .NET. Automation drives much of my work, developing bots, scrapers, and trading algorithms to eliminate complexity and wasted cycles. Building full-stack headless CMS systems is another area of focus, delivering flexible content management without frontend constraints. Statistical evaluations in Python round out the technical toolkit, turning raw data into actionable insights.

My approach is guided by Clean Code, the Law of Demeter, and principles like KISS and DRY. Software design employs proven patterns such as Observer, Strategy, Monad, Mixin, and Command. Preferring hand-crafted DI while favoring composition over inheritance. CUPID and SOLID principles shape architectural decisions, following the Agile Manifesto closely. 

Building graceful shutdowns and fail-fast logic into systems ensures reliability under pressure. Error handling deserves special attention: modern codebases suffer from both over-throwing exceptions and silent fallbacks that swallow failures. The right approach makes errors visible and actionable without creating noise, turning potential debugging nightmares into traceable, fixable issues.

AI handles boilerplate and simple markup. No point writing another form by hand. But complex logic? That needs human understanding. Same reason to avoid Nx and Lerna: the moment tooling becomes harder to debug than the problem it solves, it's not worth it.

Notable contributions include a merged PR to npm-packlist, improving debugging capabilities for 20+ million npm users and potentially saving thousands of developer-hours daily. Authored the PowerShell deployment script for freqtrade (30k+ GitHub stars) and implemented a scheduled trading cooldown reset feature.

Outside work, balance keeps me grounded. Taekwondo hones focus, meditation (mudras, Qi Gong) builds body awareness, and the gym builds resilience. Freeriding in winter and beach escapes on vacations. Dance styles like shuffle and hip-hop fuel creativity, while swimming refreshes. Alpha wave music keeps me in flow while coding. Visiting galleries, concerts, and social events expands perspectives and strengthens networks. Family, laughter, nature, and restoring old items keep me centered.

Creatively, Salvador Dal√≠'s surrealism provides inspiration. In programming, admiring sindresorhus for TypeScript expertise and xmatthias for Python mastery.

Open to freelance opportunities, remote or on-site, in German or English. Innovative fields such as FinTech particularly excite me.
